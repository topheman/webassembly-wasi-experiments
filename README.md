You may know WebAssembly, it's been around for a few years. Two years ago, I made a side project [topheman/rust-wasm-experiments](https://github.com/topheman/rust-wasm-experiments) to explain it to web developers with a more advanced example than the usual `add`/`substract` use case.

WebAssembly is moving beyond the browser, which means our code needs a way to talk to the system (to access resources like files, memory, network connections). This is [WASI : WebAssembly System Interface](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/).

> All WASI is Wasm, but not all Wasm is WASI

## Goal

At the time I'm writing these lines, WASI is still very early. The resources and examples are scattered on the web. My goal is to give you a set of examples with the following constraints:

- real WASI use case (filesystem access), with source code originally written in both C and Rust:
  - [./c/c-app.c](./c/c-app.c): (compiled with clang using the [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk))
  - [./rust-app/src/main.rs](./rust-app/src/main.rs): (compiled with cargo/rustc, main compiler for rust)
- multiple runtimes and target languages:
  - node ([WASI Api behind flag](https://nodejs.org/api/wasi.html)) - [source code](./node)
  - [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) - A small and efficient runtime for WebAssembly & WASI
  - python (with [wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)) - [source code](./python)
  - browser (with [wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)) - [source code](./browser)

You will also find a [lot of resources](#resources) that I gathered while I was putting this project together.

## Summary

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed:

- docker
- npm / node

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/topheman/webassembly-wasi-experiments.git
cd webassembly-wasi-experiments
npm install
make init-docker
```

## Run

You will find two programs, one written in C ([source](./c/c-app.c)), an other written in Rust ([source](./rust-app/src/main.rs)), they both do the same thing: it is a command line interface that accepts any number of arguments and writes a `tmp.txt` file with those arguments, separated by line breaks.

A [Makefile](./Makefile) is available, at any moment you can run `make help` to get the help menu.

### Outside of the browser

For each program (c or rust), you can:

1. Build the `.wasm` file with `make docker-wasm-create-{c,rust}-app`
2. Then execute the generated `.wasm` file through one of the runtimes with:

- `make docker-run-wasmtime-{c,rust}-app`
- `make docker-run-python-{c,rust}-app`
- `make run-node-{c,rust}-app`

3. Those tasks will generate a `tmp.txt` file and output its content in the terminal. This file will have been created by the selected runtime which will have compiled the `.wasm` file compiled from C or Rust.

### Inside the browser

[Demo accessible online](https://topheman.github.io/webassembly-wasi-experiments/)

The build steps are the same as for outside the browser (since we use the same C/Rust program compiled in the same way to WebAssembly):

1. Build the `.wasm` file with `make docker-wasm-create-{c,rust}-app`
2. Then build the website files and launch the server with `npm start`

Go to http://localhost:5000 with Chrome or FireFox and try the demo in the browser.

You will find the same C/Rust programs compiled to WebAssembly running inside the browser through the wasmer runtime which emulates file system bindings.

## File system access

WASI will never let you access directly to files, directories, network sockets, and other resources that are identified by UNIX-like file descriptors.

You will have to tell your runtime which resources of the host you wish to access by declaring a `preopens` property - example:

The following config means that, when executed in the WASI runtime, the `/tmp` folder on the host machine will be available at `.` (current folder) in the wasm program (much like docker volume mapping).

```js
new WASI({
  preopens: {
    '.': '/tmp',
  },
});
```
